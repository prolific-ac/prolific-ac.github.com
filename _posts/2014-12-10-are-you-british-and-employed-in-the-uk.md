Here's the deal: Take part in a scientific online study (80p for 5mins) by a researcher from <a href="http://www.rsm.nl/home/">Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University</a>, and we'll donate the proceeds from this study to charity! We'll donate not only your 80p (if you choose to), but also our earnings from this study!

It's that easy: Sign up, answer a couple of demographic questions, and you're ready to do the study. [Click here](https://prolificacademic.co.uk/study/54817d83fdf99b59cfdc3bd7) to participate.

To decide which charity the money goes to, we will ask for your suggestions and post a short poll here. 

A good deed for science & society. Via [@ProlificAc](https://twitter.com/ProlificAc).<br>
