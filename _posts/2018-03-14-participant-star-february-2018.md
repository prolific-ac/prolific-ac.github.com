We are happy to announce our participant of the month for January, Nate. He is one of the many participants powering research on Prolific. 
<p>
Last month, he got awarded a  <a href="http://blog.prolificacademic.co.uk/2017/10/26/feedback-and-stars">participant star</a> by one of our researchers, which is simply a way to say thank you for especially thorough and thoughtful contributions. This also makes her the lucky winner of a Prolific T-shirt!
<p>


<p>
Nate joined us all the way back in 2015. Here’s what he says about himself and his experience on Prolific.
<p>

<b>Prolific:</b> “Tell us something about yourself?”
<p>
<b>Nate: </b> "I'm a Computer Engineering student who enjoys completing flexible freelance work as a way to cover minor expenses and earn some spending money. As for hobbies, I enjoy video game journalism, working on my YouTube channel, and producing music.

<b>P:</b> “Where are you based?”
<p>
<b>N:</b> “I live in California, USA.”
<p>
<b>P:</b>  “What made you sign up to Prolific?”
<p>
<b>N:</b> "I discovered Prolific while looking for online work and immediately found the platform to be convenient and organized. "
<p>
<b>P:</b>  “What study has been your favourite study so far (if any)?”
<p>
<b>N:</b> "Giving feedback on movie trailers was one of my favourites. Also, any study designed as a game is entertaining to me."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What feature would you most like Prolific to implement?”
<p>	
<b>N:</b> "A mobile app would be awesome, but that might be a long-term goal."
<b>P:</b> “Anything else you'd like to say?”
<p>	
<b>N:</b> "Thanks for featuring me on the blog, and good luck to all the other Prolific participants!"
<p>

A massive thanks from our team to Nate and to the many other participants who contribute to the research projects on Prolific every single day. 🙂 🙌
