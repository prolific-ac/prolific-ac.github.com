<p>You can now run a longitudinal design on Prolific! Here are some tips on how to get started. </p>

<h3> The first study in the series</h3>

<p>
You don't have to do anything different when setting up your first study. You can follow the instructions in <a href="{{ site.url }}/2014/08/03/running-an-online-study-on-prolific-academic/">"Running an online study on Prolific Academic"</a>. </p>

<p>If you have multiple conditions make sure that you record the participant IDs of the participants who are assigned to each condiditon. </p>

<h3> The follow up studies</h3>
<p>When the first study is complete you can get the participant IDs of the relevant participants by clicking "Export Data" from your dashboard. You'll need these when setting up the rest of the studies in the series. </p>

<p>After filling out all the required information (as you would for any other study) click on the "Prescreening" tab. Scroll down to the "White List" section. Add the participant IDs of the participants you want to be able to take part in this follow up study. </p>
<div class="row col-md-offset-2">
<img class="img-responsive col-md-8" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/2014-08-03-how-to-run-a-longitutinal-study/WhiteList.png">
</div>
<p><i><b>ONLY</b></i> these participants will be able to take part in this study. They will automatically be emailed with an invitation to take part. </p>
<p>If you have multiple conditions and if you want to keep these condidtions consistent between studies you will need to set up a seperate study for each condidtion and add only those participants you want to be eligible to the "White List".  </p>
<p> That's it! If you have any questions feel free to comment below or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@prolificacademic.co.uk">info@prolificacademic.co.uk</a></p>
