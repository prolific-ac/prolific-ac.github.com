<p><font size="4"><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/world-university-rankings-2016-2017-results-announced">Times Higher Education</a> have just announced that Oxford is the first UK university to top the world university rankings. Congrats, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>! We're delighted to be part of this amazing community. ðŸŽ“ ðŸ¤“ </font></p><br>

## Our community
<p><font size="4">Oxford is where Prolific was born, and where it has made its first baby steps. At <a href="http://innovation.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University Innovation</a> and <a href="http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/">SaÃ¯d Business School</a>, we've met many great founders and entrepreneurs, like the guys from <a href="https://esplor.io/">Esplorio</a> (an app that beautifully tracks your travels), <a href="https://www.bounts.it/">Bounts</a> (an app that helps you achieve your exercise goals), <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> (an app that takes the headaches out of background checks), and <a href="http://www.cycle.land/#cyclesunshine">Cycleland</a> (the new airbnb for bikes, recently featured in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2016/08/12/how-a-non-techie-oxford-graduate-built-a-booming-online-bike-sharing-scheme/#1a3019cf454c">Forbes</a>). We've bounced around ideas over pints, brushed up our startup knowledge at two accelerators, and welcomed our first two interns in summer 2015, Franky & Isabella. We've had so much fun! </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Last week, we've opened a new chapter by joining a brand new coworking space called Openworks, which is run by the brilliant folks of <a href="http://www.openwell.co/">Openwell Oxford</a>. A bunch of interesting startups, businesses, and developers populate the space, like <a href="https://madewithjoy.org/">Made with Joy</a> and <a href="http://www.elixirtea.co.uk/">Elixir Tea</a>. This is a great chance to exchange ideas, pitch, grow, learn, and make some fabulous synergies happen! Here's what the new space looks like. Exciting times ahead! </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the coming months (and years!), we have big plans for Prolific. We want to make it the world's most fun, fair, and easy-to-use crowdsourcing platform. And most importantly, we want you â€“ our researchers and participants â€“ to have a say in our trajectory. You guys are the bread and butter of Prolific, without you we wouldn't even be a thing!</font></p><br>

## Sneak peek
<p><font size="4">Soon, we'll be revamping our user interface with the help from the brilliant guys of <a href="http://oneltd.co.uk">One Ltd</a>. We want to give Prolific a new touch and feel, and hope that our site will become a lot easier to navigate. Plus, we have a couple of exciting projects in the pipeline, which will help us to increase our outreach and social impact (more on that later).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">We'll keep you posted about what's next, and there may be an occasional survey or two to hear what you think/like/want to see.ðŸ˜Ž</font></p><br>

<p><font size="4">Stay tuned, <br>Katia, Phelim, & Kendra</font></p>
