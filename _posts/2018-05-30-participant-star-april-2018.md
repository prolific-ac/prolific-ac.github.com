We are happy to announce our participant of the month for April, Jordan. She is one of the many participants powering research on Prolific. 
<p>
Last month, she got awarded a  <a href="http://blog.prolificacademic.co.uk/2017/10/26/feedback-and-stars">participant star</a> by one of our researchers, which is simply a way to say thank you for especially thorough and thoughtful contributions. This also makes her the lucky winner of a Prolific T-shirt!
<p>


<p>
Jordan joined us last year, 2018. Here’s what she says about herself and her experience on Prolific.
<p>

<b>Prolific:</b> “Tell us something about yourself?”
<p>
<b>Jordan: </b> "I am a mother of three small children. Before having kids, I was a social worker. I enjoy traveling, sports and spending time with my family. We are about to go on our 14th cruise."

<b>P:</b> “Where are you based?”
<p>
<b>J:</b> “I am based in a suburb of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What made you sign up to Prolific?”
<p>
<b>J:</b> "I signed up for Prolific after reading about the site on Reddit. Posters on there were claiming that Prolific was legitimate. I belong to some other survey sites, but I love that many of Prolific’s surveys are for university research."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What study has been your favourite study so far (if any)?”
<p>
<b>J:</b> "My favorite study was one on self-control in regards to gambling."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What feature would you most like Prolific to implement?”
<p>	
<b>J:</b> "I like the site as is. I don’t feel like anything needs to be changed"
<p>
<b>P:</b> “Anything else you'd like to say?”
<p>	
<b>A:</b> "I am honored to be a member of the month!"
<p>

A massive thanks from our team to Jordan and to the many other participants who contribute to the research projects on Prolific every single day. 🙂 🙌
