While we were getting started and ironing out kinks we limited registration to participants with academic emails (*.ac.uk). Today, we're happy to announce that registration will now be open to everyone - all you need is a Facebook account! Just click "Login with Facebook", verify your email address and you're good to go.  


## Why do you need a Facebook account?
In short, Facebook was the easiest way for us to get started with authentication. It's important that each participant in a study is unique. We have various checks in place in the background that there are no duplicate participants. Facebook gives us an easy way to avoid individuals completing the same study multiple times. We know not everyone has a Facebook account, and over time, we hope to add additional authentication channels.

Best of luck with your studies! If you have any questions feel free to comment below or contact us at info@prolificacademic.co.uk
