We have some delightful news for researchers: Soon you will be able to flexibly recruit participants based on any demographic you are looking for. Yes, that's right: We're moving beyond the default demographics that are stored in our system (gender, age, country of birth, nationality, ethnicity, native language). 

In the future, you can request <b>any demographic</b> from us and our software will be able to <b>efficiently prescreen</b> our existing participant pool for you. In other words, we are taking away your hassle of running prescreening studies! :-)

For example: 
Let's assume you're aiming to collect responses from female employees in the UK who work part-time. To achieve this, all you need to do is get in touch with us and tell us about your eligibility requirements. We will then prescreen our pool, and deliver our prescreening results to you in a couple of days. If we can deliver a large enough sample size for you, you can then go ahead and run your study with the specified participants only. 

Prescreening made easy. On Prolific.
