We are happy to announce our participant of the month for March, Aaron. He is one of the many participants powering research on Prolific. 
<p>
Last month, he got awarded a  <a href="http://blog.prolificacademic.co.uk/2017/10/26/feedback-and-stars">participant star</a> by one of our researchers, which is simply a way to say thank you for especially thorough and thoughtful contributions. This also makes him the lucky winner of a Prolific T-shirt!
<p>

Aaron joined us back in 2016. Here’s what he says about himself and his experience on Prolific. He's on the left in the photo below.

<b>Prolific:</b> “Tell us something about yourself?”
<p>
<b>Aaron: </b> "I'm a self taught percussionist, and I play drums for a country & western band."

<b>P:</b> “Where are you based?”
<p>
<b>A:</b> “I was born and raised in Maine, USA.”
<p>
<b>P:</b>  “What made you sign up to Prolific?”
<p>
<b>A:</b> "I was intrigued by the potential to make a small supplemental income while participating in research studies that could benefit society."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What feature would you most like Prolific to implement?”
<p>	
<b>A:</b> "I would suggest a slightly improved dashboard and queue system, to allow users to more easily accept multiple studies, and complete them in order before they expire. It would encourage users to focus on the study rather than rush through trying to accept and complete as many studies as possible."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “Anything else you'd like to say?”
<p>	
<b>A:</b> "I really enjoy being a part of the Prolific AC platform; It's a great way to voice your opinion, or to provide data that could potentially benefit society as a whole."
<p>

A massive thanks from our team to Aaron and to the many other participants who contribute to the research projects on Prolific every single day. 🙂 🙌
