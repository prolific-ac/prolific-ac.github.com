We are happy to announce our first participant of the month for November, Chetta Tropiano. She is one of the many participants powering research on Prolific. 
<p>
Last month, she got awarded a participant star by one of our researchers, which is simply a way to say thank you for especially thorough and thoughtful contributions. 
<p>


<p>
Chetta has been with us for almost a year, and she loves helping with research. Here’s what she says about herself and her experience on Prolific:
<p>

Prolific: “Tell us something about yourself?”
Chetta: “I'm a college grad and I work full time in a management position. I am a parent to 3 kids and grandparent to 6. I love to spend time with my grandkids and I like to travel. My hobbies are my pets (dog, cat, fish, frog), playing video games, going to rock concerts, reading, and cooking. I do a big extended family dinner every Sunday.

P: “Where are you based?”
C: “I live in the USA in Arizona.”
<p>
P: “What made you sign up to Prolific?”
C: “I joined Prolific to help with research really. I did some time in a college lab one semester. I like the psychology surveys best as they really make me think. I will do any surveys that look interesting that will keep me engaged. I like the bonus system as it's a nice extra reward of thanks.”
<p>
P: “Anything else you’d like to say?”
C: “I spend my Prolific money on my grandkids or my pets. Going out for movies and ice cream is a popular request. Other than that I can be found surfing the web, and listening to music.”

<p>

A massive thanks from our team to Chetta and to the many other participants who contribute to the research projects on Prolific every single day. 🙂🙌
