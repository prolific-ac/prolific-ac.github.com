We are happy to announce our participant of the month for December, Mike Marg. He is one of the many participants powering research on Prolific. 
<p>
Last month, he got awarded a  <a href="http://blog.prolificacademic.co.uk/2017/10/26/feedback-and-stars">participant star</a> by one of our researchers, which is simply a way to say thank you for especially thorough and thoughtful contributions. This also makes him the lucky winner of a Prolific T-shirt!
<p>


<p>
Mike has been with us since back in 2014, in the early days of Prolific. Here’s what he says about himself and his experience on Prolific.
<p>

<b>Prolific:</b> “Tell us something about yourself?”
<p>
<b>Mike: </b> "I worked in IT for 8 years before deciding to pursue a career in classical music.  I still maintain some clients and work as a for-hire computer dude / web developer.  I also love to cook."

<b>P:</b> “Where are you based?”
<p>
<b>M:</b> “I split my year up between New York in the United States and Brussels in Belgium.”
<p>
<b>P:</b>  “What made you sign up to Prolific?”
<p>
<b>M:</b> "When I left the 70 hours a week computer world in 2013/2014 I searched for ways to continue to earn some side cash to supplement my income as a fresh musician.  I was doing some small tasks here and there on Mechanical Turk and remember seeing the launch for Prolific being tossed around the Internet."
<p>
<b>P:</b> “What feature would you most like Prolific to implement?”
<p>	
<b>M:</b> "A small but possibly useful one – an automatically generated monthly/yearly earnings would be nice to see.  Aside from that, I’m quite pleased with how Prolific has developed over the years."
<p>
<b>P:</b>  “Anything else you’d like to say?”
<p>
<b>M:</b> “I really believe the average completion times and estimated rate per hour are what set Prolific apart from other survey sites like MTurk.  It’s why it’s the site I usually check first and recommend to those of my friends who are interested in participating in these types of studies (as well as earning a little bit of side cash)."

A massive thanks from our team to Mike and to the many other participants who contribute to the research projects on Prolific every single day. 🙂 🙌
