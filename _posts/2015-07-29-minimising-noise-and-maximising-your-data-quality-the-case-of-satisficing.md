<p><font size="4"><br>Participants may not always read or follow instructions as carefully as we would like it. Because letâ€™s face it: Just like everybody else, even the most diligent participants sometimes get tired or distracted. As a result, they may engage in <i>satisficing</i> as a means to decrease effort and conserve their cognitive resources (Krosnick, 1991).</font></p> 

<p><font size="4">Satisficing refers to the tendency to provide a minimally acceptable response rather than the optimal response or solution. Unfortunately, when participants satisfice and do not properly follow instructions, this introduces noise in your data. As researchers, it is in our interest to minimize noise as much as possible so that we can have a clear understanding of what our data is trying to tell us. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">So what can we do to minimize this noise that results from satisficing? A straightforward and simple solution is to introduce attention checks or an Instructional Manipulation Check (IMC; Oppenheimer, Mayvis, & Davidenko, 2009) in your study. We highly recommend that you use IMCs when running studies on Prolific.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Benefits of adding an IMC in your study:<br>
1. Decreases noise in your data and thus increases statistical power <br>
2. Increases reliability and validity of your data 
</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's an example of an IMC:</font></p>
