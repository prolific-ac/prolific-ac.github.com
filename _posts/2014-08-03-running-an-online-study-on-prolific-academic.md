<p>So, you want to run an online study? Here's some tips on how to get started. </p>

<h2> (1) Calculating Your Study Cost</h2>
<p>After you’ve logged in, go to “Dashboard” and then to "Account" and use the study cost calculator to determine what your study will cost:</p>
<div class="row col-md-offset-2">
 <img class="col-md-8" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/2014-08-03-running-an-online-study-on-prolific-academic/1a.png">
</div>
<h2>(2) Topping Up Your Account</h2>
<p>After you have calculated the study cost, you will need to top up your account, which you can easily do by credit card. Just enter the amount by which you would like to top up your account, and click the green button “pay with card”. The following window will appear prompting you for your credit card details:</p>
<div class="row col-md-offset-3">
<img class="col-md-6 " style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/2a.png">
</div>
<h2>(3) Setting Up Your Study</h2>
<p>As soon as you have successfully topped up your account, go to "Create New Study". Here, you have two options: "General Settings" (required) and "Advanced Settings" (optional):</p>
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/3a.png">
<p> In "General Settings" enter all the information relevant to your study (name of study, number of participants required, etc.). For “estimated completion time” please fill in the average time that you predict it will take participants to fill in your survey. For “maximum completion time”, please fill in the amount of time during which participants are allowed to take your survey. This is an important feature that you can make use of, especially in experimental designs when you want your participants to complete the study straight away and with no or few interruptions. </p>
<p>
Please note: you will have to create a study code, e.g. “CEBEGPROLIFIC1”, which you present to participants at the very end of your survey. Participants will have to submit your study code on our website as soon as they have completed your study – this way it can be verified that they completed your study and they can be rewarded later on. This is how you could phrase it at the end of your survey:
</p>

<p>Moreover: when you build your survey, please add one item at the very beginning where you ask participants for the Prolific Academic ID. This way you will be able to track study submissions. E.g., it could look as follows:</p>
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/3c.png">
<p> In "Advanced Settings" you have the option to enter pre-screening criteria so that only participants with certain demographic characteristics can participate in your study. Just move the criterion that you require from the left box of the page into the right box, such as here (the researcher chose only UK nationals to participate):</p>

<h2>(4) Preview Your Study</h2>
<p>Now, you may preview your study: </p>

<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/4b.png">

<h2>(5) Post Your Study</h2>
<p>If you're happy with what you see, you can go ahead and post it! Just click “Confirm your study”. Then, you will be automatically redirected to “Manage Studies”, where you can keep track of your studies.</p>
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/5a.png">
<p>This is how your study will look to participants. Your survey will be integrated into the Prolific Academic website, so there’s no need to open a new window:</p>
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/5b.png">
<h2>(6) Review Study Submissions</h2>
<p>When you go to “Manage Studies”, you will be able to keep track of all your studies. Here, you will find your latest study under: Studies in Progress</p>
<!-- <img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/6a.png">
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/6b.png">
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="https://prolificacademic.co.uk/assets/img/hiwr/6c.png"> -->
<p>Under “Studies in Progress”, you will find the study you have just posted. The progress bar below will indicate how many participants have started and completed your study (it will refresh every few seconds). You can even share your study with others by clicking on the Twitter icon. In case you would like to, you may terminate your study anytime by clicking the “stop this study” button.</p>
<img class="col-md-12" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/2014-08-03-running-an-online-study-on-prolific-academic/6d.png">

<p> You can review your participants at any time by clicking "manage participants"</p>

<p>Now, you will see a list of participants ready to be reviewed. If you are dissatisfied with some of your data, it lies at your discretion to reject certain study submissions. The participant ID helps you identify whose study submission to accept or to reject.</p>

<p>If you decide to reject someone’s work, you will be prompted to give a reason for the rejection. We deem this an important step to maintain trust and understanding between researchers and participants. Prolific Academic will always automatically republish rejected assignments so new participants can complete your study and you do not have missing data:</p>

<p>As soon as you have reviewed (i.e. approved or rejected) your participants, you are finished! Enjoy analysing your data.</p>
